I am Talha Safa KÃ¼Ã§Ã¼k and currently, I am studying at Bilkent University. My department is Computer Science. I am from Manisa and for university, I am in Ankara after that. I am currently learning Java. In the past, I learned the basics of C#, C++ and Python. However, because I didn't have any time to improve them, I forgot mostly unfortunately.
